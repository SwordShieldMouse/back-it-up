\begin{preface}
This thesis was compiled and extended from a submission to NeurIPS 2020, in collaboration with Sungsu Lim and Martha White. Sungsu contributed description of soft value functions, analysis of the heatmaps, the heatmaps themselves, and the continuous-action control experiments. Martha contributed parts of the introduction, the discussion on the weighting of states, some general suggestions throughout, and a modification to one or the proofs. Hugo Luis Silva also helped in checking the proofs. All other contributions are my own.
